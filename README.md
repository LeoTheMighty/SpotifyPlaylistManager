# Playlist Manager for Spotify
### By Leo Belyi

## Why?

bro literally my god damn playlists are horrendously hard to manage, whenever I have a song that I like I have to add them to like 5 different playlistsbecause of how I have things organized. I think it might be cool to automate this process a lot faster through a playlist manager.

## What does it do?

I'm thinking of having a chain of updates, so for instance there will be playlists that will automatically update based on other playlists. My "Recommended Songs" should have all the songs that I add to any of my "we listening" playlists.
